Readme.txt

This file provides an overview of the files submitted for the project work.

1) CodeBook.Rmd describes the structure (observations/variables) of the files used in the analysis, as well as the transformations to get from the initial data set to the final result. The code chunks are for illustration purpose only and not executable.

2) run_analysis.R contains the code that does the actual getting, cleaning and transformation of the data. As introduced in the course the libraries dplyr, data.table and tidyr are used and you might have to install them (install.packages(<library_name>).
